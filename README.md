# Search-Engine-python-NLP-TF-IDF
This project involves preprocessing 10 U.S. inaugural address documents and a query through tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and computing tf-idf weights, followed by cosine similarity analysis to identify the document most similar to the query based on normalized weights.
